# React + Vite

App deployment: https://battleship-react-game.netlify.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Step 1: Set up your development environment

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
Create a new React project using create-react-app or your preferred method.

Step 2: Project Structure

Organize your project files and directories. A simple structure might include folders like components, containers, styles, and utils.

Step 3: Create the Game Board

Create a 2D grid (matrix) using a two-dimensional array to represent the game board. Each cell can have one of several states: empty, containing a ship, hit, or miss.
Create a Board component that receives the game board as props and renders the grid using nested loops to generate cells.
You can use CSS or a styling library to style the board cells, ensuring it's visually appealing.

Step 4: Place Ships on the Board

Define ship types and their sizes, such as battleship, cruiser, destroyer, etc.
Create a function that randomly places these ships on the game board. Make sure that the ships don't overlap or extend beyond the grid.
Keep track of ship positions and their status (e.g., whether they are sunk or not) in a state variable.

Step 5: User Interaction

Implement event handlers for user interaction. For example, add a click event to each cell on the game board.
When a user clicks a cell, determine whether it's a hit or a miss. You can do this by checking the cell's state against the ship positions.
Update the game board state to reflect the result of the user's move, whether it's a hit (change the cell's state to "hit") or a miss (change the cell's state to "miss").
You might want to disable clicks on cells that have already been selected to prevent the user from clicking them again.

Step 6: Game Logic

Implement the game logic to check for wins or losses. The game ends when all the ships are sunk.
Create a function to check the status of each ship. When all ships are marked as "sunk," display a message indicating that the user has won.
Implement a limit on the number of moves the player can make. If the player exceeds this limit without sinking all the ships, show a message indicating that they have lost.

Step 7: Displaying Ship Locations (Optional)

For debugging or to allow users to see ship locations, you can create a "cheat mode" button that reveals the ship locations.
Implement a toggle mechanism that switches between displaying ships (in a different color) or hiding them.
You can add this functionality as a button or a checkbox in your game interface.

Step 8: Styling

Add CSS or use a styling library like styled-components to make your game visually appealing. Style the game board and ships as you prefer.

Step 9: Game Control

Add game control elements, such as a "Start New Game" button to reset the board and start a new game.

Step 10: Test and Debug

Thoroughly test your game, fix any bugs or issues, and ensure it works as expected.

Step 11: Deployment

Once your Battleship game is complete, you can deploy it to a web hosting platform of your choice, such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.
